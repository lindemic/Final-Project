# Final-Project
This code takes a DNA sequence and translates it into its corresponding amino acid sequence with one letter amino acid codes. It then calculates the length of the sequence, the frequence of each amino acid in the sequence by percentage, and plots the frequecy in a pie chart.
This code needs for input: File containing DNA sequence and file containing key to translate DNA sequence to amino acid sequence.
This code outputs: Frequency of each amino acid in the sequence as a precentage and pie plot of amino acid frequency by percentage.
