# Final-Project
This code takes a DNA sequence and translates it into its corresponding amino acid sequence represented by one letter amino acid codes. It then calculates the length of the amnio acid sequence, the frequency of each amino acid in the sequence by percentage, and plots the frequecy by percentage in a pie chart.
This code needs for input: txt file containing DNA sequence with the entire sequence listed in a single line with no separating characters and the txt file containing key to translate DNA sequence to amino acid sequence using one letter amino acid codes.
This code outputs: Total number of amino acids in the sequence, frequency of each amino acid in the sequence as a precentage and pie plot of amino acid frequency by percentage.
