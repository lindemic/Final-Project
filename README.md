# Final-Project
This code takes a DNA sequence and translates it into its corresponding amino acid sequence with one letter amino acid codes. It then calculates the length of the sequence, the frequence of each amino acid in the sequence by percentage, and plots the frequecy in a pie chart.
Input: File containing DNA sequence
File containing key to translate DNA sequence to amino acid sequence
Output: Pie plot of amino acid frequency by percentage
